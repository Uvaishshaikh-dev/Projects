Hello!, I'm Uvaish shaikh(SCSE-Section21) and a first year.
I don't really know much about programming, im aware of python and its basics, the loops and how some codes work.
I grasp knowledge quick and can implement it quickly. If I were to be given a task to be done by a deadline, I'd try to finish the work before the deadline.
